        <p>cosmOS is eternal and has ebbed through the souls of mankind since the begining. The hands of those who invoke its name are blessed but unimportant.</p>

        <h2>The Spark</h2>
            <p>Despite being well mapped, clearly observable phenmenon, there are many missing details in regards to cosmOS and The Veil. The widespread addition of the internet to many homes and businesses has directly contributed to its linger effects, but the causes are murky and contradictory. Officially, No One knows who/what makes cosmOS.</p>
            <p>There are multiple theories, as to who touched The Veil first and their origins. We are not sure of their origins, goals or even if they are finished toying with the world.</p>
            <p>The Developers are any individuals or collectives believed to have discovered how to write the rules for reality itself. These developers have become legends in their own right, mythic figures believed to be playing just behind the scenes of nearly everything.</p>
        <h2>The Distributors</h2>
            <P>To access cosmOS, or enter The Veil safely, a COMP is required, which has properly been installed and configured with a cosmOS Distribution. Since this is one of the most front-facing and interactable components, it would make sense that the Distributors have a special spotlight, as those who are actively inviting the living into the realms of the unreal.</p>
