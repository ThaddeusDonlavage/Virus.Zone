            <h2>What is the Veil?</h2>
             <p>The Veil is any liminal boundary between the physical world and cosmOS, a fluctuating phenomena where digital logic and subconscious myth bleed into one another. Despite all rational thought that would assume anything virtual would not affect the real world, instead, it exists as a transitional layer of semi-physical resonance, shaped by belief, signal interference, ambient emotion, and the countless psychic impressions generated by humanities subconcious.</p>

              <p>The Veil is a broad term to describe any instances where cosmOS leaks into waking life—and where waking life leaves fingerprints onto cosmOS. It is a place of half-truths, hallucinations, déjà vu, and the quiet sensation of being spied on.</p>

            <h2>Common Features</h2>
            <h3>The Reality Flucuates</h3>
            <p>Spaces overtaken by The Veil consists of spaces, sensations, and events that do not conform cleanly to physical laws nor digital ones. Sometimes subtle, but almost always observable, there should be some spacial differences in the world. It can manifest as television static in alleyway shadows, liminal hallways going to nowhere, abandoned buildings in spaces where they shouldn't fit into, and anything that could leave a sense of dread in the air. These “thin points” a direct cosmOS influence on the physical realm.</p>

            <h3>Psychic Echoes</h2>
            <p>Despite the distinct lack of reality, there is an underlying answer to absolutely everything. Since part of infection of Veil is caused in-part by the subconcious, it makes sense that there would be elements of The Veil that tend to resonate to some sort of vibe. </p>
            <p>Thoughts, fears, memories, and cultural myths can imprint themselves into The Veil. Over time, these impressions can become semi-autonomous digital phantoms, all archetypal illusions—that drift along the boundary layer. It would not be unheard of for these phantoms to mimic different characters from folklore or pop culture.</p>

            <h3>Electrical Instability</h3>
            <p>When The Veil first enters into the physical world, it requires a conduit to begin leaking from. This can be somewhat controlled with a skilled and trained summoner with a COMP, the bulk ignitions come from accidents, coincidences and tragedies. That being said, lights, television, phones or anything else electrical will quickly become controlled by the Veil. These devices can often coordinate towards some goal, such as either luring people in or making them stay far away. Anything from flickering lights, to altered phone service or voice mimicry coming out of speakers is possible.</p>
