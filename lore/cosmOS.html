      <h2>What is cosmOS?</h2>
      <p>cosmOS is the omnipresent system that underpins the extended digital reality. It is a vast, interconnected cyberspace network that allows for seamless interaction between all digital and metaphysical entities, using a projection of the visitors psyche. cosmOS is both a digital and metaphysical construction, blending technology with the subconcious.</p>

      <h2>Key Features of cosmOS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Universal Connectivity:</strong> Every piece of network technology, from CDs to mainframes to Facebook memes connects cosmOS in some way.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Reality:</strong> Each node of cosmOS maintains its own internal logic, seperate to our native laws of physics and natural perceptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Streams:</strong> Information flows through cosmOS in the form of data streams that can be accessed, hacked, or corrupted.</li>
        <li><strong>Resonance:</strong> The propagation of signals within cosmOS can shift physical reality</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Interaction with cosmOS</h2>
      <p>The only way to directly access cosmOS is through specialized interfaces known as COMPs. Interacting with cosmOS through COMPs allows users to perform actions such as augmenting reality, accessing hidden knowledge, and directly entering a node within the network. Understanding and mastering cosmOS is crucial for survival in this fractured universe.</p>

      <h2>Nodes</h2>
      <p>Nodes are the localized instances of cosmOS that exhibit unique characteristics and rules, which are also fully traversable. Each node can represent a different environment, set of physical laws, or metaphysical properties. Navigating between nodes requires skill and knowledge of cosmOS's structure, and is often a dangerous endeavor due to the unpredictable nature of the cyberspace.
      </p>

        <p>Normal networks, such as those accessible on the internet, have largely been created with some planned function. Whether it was a person physically writing a code, or an algorithm generating it. Nodes within cosmOS, however, can be entirely emergent phenomena. They can arise spontaneously, or as a result of repeated interactions with cosmOS and the Veil. It's believed cosmOS is a dynamic and ever-changing landscape, where new nodes can theoretically appear and disappear without warning. That being said, some nodes have remained stable for extended periods, becoming well-known locations within cosmOS.
        </p>

      <h2>Relationship with The Veil</h2>
      <p>cosmOS and The Veil are intrinsically linked, given that The Veil is believed to be a physical manifestation of effects of cosmOS. As The Veil thins, the boundaries between physical reality and cosmOS become increasingly blurred. This allows for greater interaction between the two realms, but also increases the risk of corruption and instability within both. Repeated mistreatment of a cosmOS node can lead to unpredictable consequences for all those in the surrounding area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entities from beyond The Veil, such as Demons and Sprites, are often able to manipulate cosmOS in ways that defy conventional understanding. Their presence within cosmOS is almost directly tied to a server node, which they call home. These entities can exploit the unique properties of cosmOS to exert influence over physical reality, often for purposes with bizarre or alien desires.
