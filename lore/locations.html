        <h2>Nodes</h2>
          <h3>Hammer Reach</h3>
            <p>A place of rolling fields, fierce dragons, and dim taverns warm with song and candlelight. This hardcore fantasy roleplay server has maintained a large deal of acclaim for its awe inspiring world design and also tender care of first-time visitors. Visitors arrive expecting an evening of quests and loot, and some are suprised to find out that they stop thinking about leaving.</p>
            <p>The players of the Hammer Reach simulation, are largely segregated into two communities who are treated differently by the NPCs of the fantasy world. Wayfarers, the travelling adventurers who come in search of fun and glory are handed more quests than Rooted players, those who have made Hammer Reach more of their physical life and often take more mundane roles within the fantasy villages, immersing themselves fully and often giving up their real world names in favor of their fantasy persona.</p>
            <p>The Rooted players are not trapped by force. The logout process still functions. COMPs still respond if invoked. Instead, departures seem to be delayed more and more by obligations, time-sensitive quests, and promises that all evoke more urgency and rewards than those in the real world. There is a clear report of subtle resistance from the game world, like it is being actively tailored to fit your internal fantasies, and many share stories of losing friends to the digital community.</p>
            <p>The world continues to change and progress. Prayers to the world's God are answered with an unsettling consistency. New Festivals and Holidays come and go in ways that cannot be mapped to any known calendar. The world's weight is expanding over what seems to be a massive and increasing depth in dungeons and dangerous barren lands, that the native human like AI seem largely frightened of.</p>
          <h3>The Lanntern Market</h3>
            <p>The Latern Market is one of the most infamous Nodes across cosmOS. A heinous place known for any sort of black market, nearly untraceable deal, entry is only possible with an NFT copy of a gold coin within The Veil, which is meant to transport the user directly to a relavent vendor for whatever they are requesting.</p>
            <p> The sprawling bazaar is a haze of cigarette smoke and incense, in a seemingly endless series of hallways and staircases, modelled after Kowloon Walled City, and lit by a series of floating dim orange paper lanterns. </p>
            <p> Vendors here sell everything from illegal software, weaponized COMPs, forbidden knowledge, and even more exotic fare such as memories, emotions, and rare Sprites. The clientele is just as varied, with everyone from low-level hackers to powerful corporate execs and shadowy government agents all mingling together in the crowded stalls. </p>
            <p> The Shopkeeper Sprites that operate the location are large humanoid rat creatures, hunched and bipedal, and drapped in Persian rugs ordained with anything from Christmas ornaments to prized gold medals. They are known as the Lantern Keepers and are known as shrewd negotiators, often wishes for fetters or rituals performed in the real world to provide shoppers with the goods they desire. 
            </p>
          <h3>The Sea Drift Mall</h3>
            <p>The architecural style of this large publically accessable shopping center suggests, it was built as a mall first, and a spaceship second. All its transparent ceilings and curved windows show that The Sea Drift is flying through the vast reaches of space, but a closer eye would notice many of the propulsion devices present do not make much scientific sense. </p>
            <p>The Sea Drift features number small convienance stores, all with little bits, bobs or specialties, some offering pretzels, where others sell T-shirts, each seperated by long and often empty corridors of rounded plastics, colored in soft pinks and pearlescent lights, looking more like a doll's house than a real lived-in location. At times it can be descriped as both insulating and profoundly exposing. </p>
            <p>There are quite a number of Sprites who freely live in the community of The Sea Drift Mall. Many are invited from other home worlds, and often have a distinctly alien quality. The natives, who make up the overwhelming majority of shop creatures take the form of a humanoids with the faces of a dolphin, with luminous and smooth skin, and float slowly on their bipedal limbs as if buoyed by an unseen current. They can fully communicate, but only their native language of high-pitched clicks and whistles, with a language translating app being a popular device for sale. </p>
            <p>The general reputation of Sea Drift Mall, is greatly positive. It is one of if not the most safe public facing Nodes, and as such has become a very popular exchange point, where rivals can meet under the pretenses of food and fun. The Sea Drift Mall is also home to a thriving night life scene. It features a number of popular bars and restaurants, and namely a number of drugs capable of inducing anything from pleasure, comfort, altered moods and curated memories, these effects lasting long after leavingt cosmOS logout times. </p>
            <p> Conflict at the Sea Drift Mall is a rare but known occurance, mainly in the long string of poorly mapped and identical corridors, in the underbellies of the mall, where the locals often dare not enter. The Drifters, often referred to as The Spacians, have their own internal police force, and its believed that they and the shopkeepers report directly to an unknown Entity known as The Captain, whom access to is entirely restricted to any visitor.</p>
            <p> Using The Sea Drift Mall in Virus.Zone will give players a safe starting location to explore cyberspace, it can be used to juxtapose some of the more dangerous while still allowing for intrigue for those interested. Just what is exactly happening in the restricted areas? What might happen if a human tries opening a shop in Sea Drift? Are the Spacians themselves up to something? </p>


        <h2>The Veil</h2>
          <h3>Red Hollow, Kansas</h3>
            <p>Red Hollow is a small town you have seen before, even if you have never been there.</p>
            <p>Just off a two-lane highway, surrounded by forests, some farmland and a quiet infrasturcutural decay that has been creeping in since the time of the Dust Bowl. The town is lucky to have as many ammenities has it does, asside from the non-existant cell service. A diner that hasn't changed its menu in seventy years, a high school football field responsible for over half of the town's income, and an honestly wholesome and welcoming community, for the most part.</p>
            <p>But there are whispers, that something just isn't quite right about Red Hollow. Some blame the nearby Air Force base, and all kinds of secret government experiments they must be running. Others are quick to mention the ancient Native American burial grounds that were built just below the high school causing problems. Others say its just as simple as some cryptids or UFOs moved into down and haven't made an effort to leave just yet. </p>
            <p>There's been a number of recent disappearances, teenagers mostly. Calls from the missing or the dead in the middle of the night. Packages delivered and paid for in their name appearing months after leaving without a trace. Odd sightings late at night of a Red Mist and a deep sanguine mud with a sickly-sweet candy smell. Most folks have begun going to bed early sever since a strange serious of messages seem to work their way into any television or radio they listen to after a certain point at night.</p>
            <p>Using Red Hollow in Virus.Zone is recommended with slow-burn horror and character-focused drama. The threats here can be apocalpytic but are intimate first and foremost. Dangers lie in the quiet sacrifices that are made just under the noses of the well-intentioned masses, that that some people will keep those in-tact to keep up the status quo. </p>

        <h2>The Waking World</h2>
          <h3>Austin, Texas</h3>
            <p>Some people say that Austin is weird on purpose. Over the last couple of years, the city has absorbed a number of new faces, all of which wanting to capitalize on the new booming tech scene and the new trendy goal of becoming a micro-celebrity. Happy smiles, ice-bath plunges, monetization and denial are enough for most in this city. </p>
            <p>In the new land of the podcast, it seems that breaches in The Veil almost always take the form of some viral trend. A few hundred people will become eventually possessed for as short as an hour to as long as a few weeks to paint everything they can see blue, and eventually someone will co-opt it as either an art piece or a marketing campaign. It's become a city of plausible deniablity in favor of a recent uptick in tourism. </p>
            <p>Austin loves attention. As a consequence of this COMP users can operate openly and aggressively, provided they don't step on any toes. Corporations in the know are happy to let the low-end COMP users try out their tricks in this city, most likely to collect their data and observe the effects in a place where they can get away with it. The end result of this is a Wild West situation of a few talented individuals having free reign. </p>
            <p>For a campaign, Austin offers activism, heroism, and survival. In Austin, the promise is always the same: community, expression, a better version of yourself The ugly truth is that something else is looking for all that as well, and it’s getting very good at controlling you.</p>
          <h3>Tokyo, Japan</h3>
            <p>Tokyo is a city of reflection. Towering buildings of glass and steel stack atop one another, each with about a dozen antennae broadcasting a slightly different frequency. Screens are omnipresent. Advertisements blur seamlessly into public announcements, idol performances, transit updates, and personal feeds. It is impossible to tell where civic messaging ends and entertainment begins.</p>
            <p>The city was always famous for its technology. Robotics labs, consumer electronics giants, and network infrastructure companies maintain glittering headquarters here. For the trained eye, its remarkable just how popular cosmOS has become without the average person noticing. COMPs are lifestyle accessories. Fashion statements. Tools of personal branding. Some just seem luckier, more charismatic, or more visible than others. The negative affects are all silenced against the backdrop of neon.</p>
            <p>The Veil in Tokyo is able to hide in plain sight. Sprites, often referred to as Yokai, in the local scene often inhabit and take control of mascots, avatars, virtual assistants, and brand personalities to integrate themselves in the real world. Viral online movements can often form which may  induce shared dreams tied to ongoing media or news events. Entire neighborhoods may often adopt strange behaviors and fully formed new slang as if possessed by some new trend or product.</p>
            <p>The most dangerous aspect of Tokyo, often referred to by the locals as 20XX, the cities infastructure seemingly crumbles or falls apart to any deeply tied to the energy of the city. This world seemingly shows images of the future, often featuring large bonfires and layers of sand.</p>
            <p>Tokyo often offers a promise to its citizens, that anyone can become someone if they are willing to obey hard enough and long enough. The only cost is the erosion of the self.</p>
            <p>In Virus.Zone, choosing Tokyo as a setting gives a lot of room for possible investigations. Campaigns can involve corporate espionage, celebrity worshipping cults, or the quiet terror of urban unease. CyberPunk here is not Science Fiction, but a matter of fact.</p>
