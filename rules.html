      <h1>Game Rules</h1>
      <p>Core rules and tableflow for Virtual Veil, summarized for quick reference.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
      <h2>Core Concept</h2>
      <p>Virtual Veil is a tabletop roleplaying game which uses the One-Roll Engine (ORE) as a baseline.</p>
      <p> It is recommended that each player, including the Compiler, bring a set of ten ten-sided dice, which will be referred to as a <strong>d10</strong>, or <strong>digits</strong>. In ORE systems, the success of any action requires a number of dice to be rolled, and at least one match pair of the same number rolled. The easiest success is called a <strong>Dub</strong>, which just means you have a matching pair. Similarly other successes may be described as trips, quads, and quints respectively. There are instances of difficulty which may require more than a pair, such as a triple but those cases will be discussed later. The meaning will be explained later, but when making a roll, all active dice in play will be referred to as the <strong>register</strong>. Use the <a href="panels/mechanics.html">Core Mechanics</a> panel for full resolution examples.</p>

      <p>Remember, you aren’t telling a story explicitly when a group sits around a table to play the game. The story grows from the collections of decisions and outcomes rolled by dice. As a general rule, if an activity would be considered somewhat trivial such as buying cereal at a grocery store, showering, going to sleep or driving a few hours to work, you do not need to roll, you may complete them automatically. Only force a roll when the outcome is uncertain or contested.</p>

      <h2>Hierarchy of Mechanics</h2>

      <h3>Storage</h3>
      <p>The term for stats that are roughly set in stone for the present moment. These include stats, skills, and your Computers specifications, software and operating systems. Storage is the term for the character sheet which will not be affected directly by random rolls. It’s called storage because it’s roughly locked away and you shouldn’t need to edit any information in it unless you are purchasing items or changing major details about your character.</p>

      <h3>Cache</h3>
      <p>Cache represents temporary or dynamic information that can change frequently during gameplay. This includes things like current health, temporary buffs or debuffs, and other situational modifiers. The most important of these modifiers the <strong>data cache</strong>, a set of dice that are pre-rolled as soon as you boot your cosmOS. The data cache can be used as a die to be added to any normal roll and then expanded during play. Additionally, damage is considered to be stored in the cache which will be covered more in the Combat section. Cache effects are not permanent but do take more time to get rid of than register effects. </p>

      <h3>Register</h3>
      <p>The register is the pool of dice that are actively rolled to resolve actions. The most random and violate of stats, the register is in reference to all current dice rolled for a specific purpose, which only will last for the current round. There are several things that can happen to the register while it is still in play. Remember, you keep your dice in the data cache as long as your comp is still running, you discard all dice in your register unless told otherwise. Moving dice from the register to the cache is called <strong>loading</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Adding Or Subtracting</h2>
      <p>Sometimes for the purposes of comparing rolls or using modifiers, the individual number on the die matters, not just that they are pairs. You can convert each roll made into a numerical value by using the number of matching pairs as the tens digit and the actual face number as the ones digit. For example, three sevens would be represented as <strong>37</strong>. Adding or subtracting rolls can potentially turn a failure into a success, since an individual die could theoretically be turned into a pair or vice-versa.</p>

      <h2>Types of Moves</h2>

      <h3>Basic Actions</h3>
      <p>Any Action that requires at minimum a dub to be rolled is considered a Basic Action.</p>

      <h3>Free Actions</h3>
      <p>An action that can be declared on your turn without having to worry about dice. Examples include talking, adjusting clothing, or messing with smaller gadgets.</p>

      <h3>Minor Actions</h3>
      <p>Any action which can be completed with less than a dub, usually a singular die. Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, it may be difficult to complete tasks that would otherwise be trivial. These are referred to as Minor Actions. Minor Actions can be performed in tandem with any other normal actions on a turn, provided there is at least one die that can be used for it. For example, getting back up from the ground is a Minor Action. These do not count as Combos or Strings.</p>

      <h3>Special Actions</h3>
      <p>Special Actions are only possible by unleashing the primal power deep within cosmOS. Special Actions have a minimum requirement of dice that must be made up of dice exclusively in the cache.</p>

      <h3>Combos and Strings</h3>
      <p>Normally each action coincides with one roll from the register. There are certain triggers which allow multiple actions to be taken in quick succession within the same round. Since the actions are occurring in the same round, the register will remain on the board.</p>

      <p><strong>Combo:</strong> Any Action that will always be allowed to be completed as a secondary after an initial action takes place on that turn.</p>

      <p><strong>String:</strong> A second independent action done within that turn which is not dependent on the first.</p>

      <h2>Physical Stats</h2>

      <h3>Body Stats</h3>
      <p><strong>Agility:</strong> How fast are you? If you want a character that’s quick on their toes and has great reaction time, you’d want high Agility. Agility controls physical speed and also the speed by which your hands and body can interface with the digital world. Agility can also be used to avoid taking damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Physique:</strong> How obviously in shape are you? The tone of your muscles and your ability to carry heavy objects. Most attacks that rely on brute strength or athletic skill are rolled with your Physique stat.</p>

      <p><strong>Precision:</strong> How good are you at using your hands, or coordination in general. Characters with excellent Precision may be great at driving, pickpocketing, performing, or painting. Some weapons rely on Precision, such as guns.</p>

      <p><strong>Vitality:</strong> How is your health in general? Unlike the other three stats which control exertion, Vitality is your ability to remain resilient. It governs resistance to poisons, disease, and helps reduce the risk of dangers.</p>

      <h2>Mind Stats</h2>

      <p><strong>Cyber:</strong> How computer literate are you? High Cyber allows you to find information quickly, excel in digital competitions, or write effective code. In the Digital World, Cyber often plays the role Physique plays in the Walking World.</p>

      <p><strong>Engineering:</strong> How handy are you? Engineering is your ability to fix, repair, troubleshoot, and sabotage technology.</p>

      <p><strong>Ingenuity:</strong> How sharp is your mind? Ingenuity represents creativity and the ability to deduce and improvise solutions. Many spells and technological abilities rely on Ingenuity.</p>

      <p><strong>Wit:</strong> How well studied are you? Build a character with high Wit if you want strong contextual knowledge, street smarts, or academic understanding. Wit also controls combat initiative.</p>

      <h2>Spirit Stats</h2>

      <p><strong>Charisma:</strong> How persuasive are you? High Charisma helps in convincing others, building influence, or running social campaigns.</p>

      <p><strong>Confidence:</strong> How good are you at convincing yourself? Confidence helps you overcome disadvantages and push through difficult situations.</p>

      <p><strong>Performance:</strong> How good are you at affecting others' perceptions? Performance covers acting, singing, deception, and similar social displays.</p>

      <p><strong>Stealth:</strong> How often are you unnoticed? High Stealth allows you to move unseen and avoid detection in both real and digital spaces.</p>
