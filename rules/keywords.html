        <h2>Action Keywords</h2>

        <h4>Basic Actions</h4>

        <p> Basic actions are actions which would normally be fairly simple in a lax setting but in times of crisis or combat require some strain, or complications may occur. All basic actions require one dice to be discarded from the register or the cache.</p>

        <h4>Cache</h4>
        A storage location in the game state. Typically, Cache die or effects will carryover from one scene or combat to the next, usually having unique features.

        <h4>Chips</h4>
        <p>Term for the modular abilities that control unique aspects of an entity.</p>

        <h4>Error (Debuff, Penalty)</h4>
        <p>Most negative circumstances are reflected as Errors within the game. A standard Error will be used to mean that the difficulty of any action is elevated by one, meaning that a trip roll would be equivalent to a dub roll while one Error is applied, and a dub would be considered a failure.</p>

        <h4>Power</h4>
        <p>
            Each Action is given a Power value, based on the number of matching dice used to make it possible. Power is equivalent to Width in most One Roll Engine game systems.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Register
        </h4> <p>The proper term for the pool of dice rolled at the begining of each turn, or the dice rolled on any action outside of Combat.</p>

        <h4>Stats</h4>
        <p> The manifestation of the character which has been distilled into a number to determine action results.</p>

        <p>All stats start at one die and cannot go over more than five naturally. The 12 stats are Agility, Physique, Precision, Vitality, Cyber, Engineering, Ingenuity, Wit, Charisma, Confidence, Performance, and Stealth.</p>



        <h2>Ability Modifiers</h2>

        <h4>Hit Stun</h4>
        <p>A gnarly and vicious modifier. When an Attack or ability is using the Hit-Stun modifier, the active user selects one die from the target entities Register Pool and removes it from play.</p>

        <p><strong>Nice (Ability Modifier):</strong> When an ability has the Nice Modifier, you may match up to one 9 with a set of 6s or vice versa, to the lowest possible combination of just the two dice by themselves. This is a stackable modifier.</p>

        <p><strong>Outthink (Minor Attack, Reaction):</strong> Outthink allows you to move before an opponent in a moment of conflict, provided your Thinking Initiative is higher.</p>

        <p><strong>Powerful (Ability Modifier):</strong> If a roll is considered a success with the Potent ability, you may calculate it as if you had one set larger for the purposes of damage calculations or effects.</p>

        <p><strong>Quick (Ability Modifier):</strong> Having a Quick die on any ability means that it counts as faster when calculating the resolution of attacks, equivalent to a +2 score. Stackable.</p>

        <p><strong>Sturdy (Ability Modifier):</strong> An ability that is Sturdy has one level of protection for the purposes of avoiding errors when making actions on their turn. This is a stackable modifier.</p>

        <h2>Dice</h2>

        <h4>Error Die</h4>
        <p> a negative die, which may stay in the Cache or Register until a matching digit appears, in which case one standard die and one error die are removed from play. For example, if a player rolls three 7s but has an Error die in the cache with a value of 7, one 7 from both the cache and the register is removed, and the result is a dub.</p>

        <h4>Fault Die</h4>
        <p>Fault die are the cummulation of damage on the virtual and physical systems of the player character. Each 'success' when rolled with Fault die reduces Vitality by one.</p>

        <h4>Wild Die</h4>
        <p><strong></strong> A Wild die, which may be called a Wild Card or Wild Character, is any die whose value is determined by the player rolling after the rest of the die have been rolled.</p>

        <h2>Lexicon</h2>
        <h4>Compiler</h4> The Game Master, the story teller in charge of the world, mechanics and overall direction of play. 
        <h4>Entity</h4>
        <p>An entity is an semi-autonomous person, or simulated fascimile of one. In game terms, all actors, PCs and NPC are considered Entities.</p>

        <h2>States and Conditions</h2>

        <p>During the play of the game, players and NPCs may be affected by States, or conditions that alter the way other stats might interact.</p>

        <h4>Beaten</h4>
        <p>A character with the Beaten State may not make an action other than Dodge or Defend, unless they attempt a successful Confidence Check at the beginning of their turn. Beaten may be removed automatically by choosing to surrender, which means giving into whatever inflicted Beaten in the first place, likely removing yourself from the situation entirely or worse.</p>

        <h4>Blinded</h4>
        <p>The character has two Errors to any rolls that rely on vision, and you cannot use any of your physical stats to reduce damage.</p>

        <h4>Buffered</h4>
        <p>You have been inflicted with a negative modifier, but that effect may be buffered, meaning that its effects are inert until your next turn.</p>

        <h4>Burned</h4>
        <p>At the start of your turn, while burned you must add an extra damage die to the pool.</p>

        <h4>Confused</h4>
        <p>Negate the next die roll you have rolled.</p>

        <h4>Deafened</h4>
        <p>You cannot hear. -1 for all combat rolls while Deafened. Any ability requiring hearing of sound is unusable.</p>

        <h4>Dull</h4>
        <p>A move, entity or stat that is dull completely ignores all Wild dice.</p>

        <h4>Error-State</h4>
        <p>For every stack of an Error-State, you must roll one extra Error Die for every action you take, and add it to your cache afterward.</p>

        <h4>Faults</h4>
        <p>Fault Dice represent the risk of failing on each turn and the wear and tear you have taken recently.</p>

        <h4>Frozen</h4>
        <p>You roll one less die on all of your physical rolls and you also have a -2 when calculating speed.</p>

        <h4>Poisoned</h4>
        <p>-1 to all Physical Stat actions.</p>

        <h4>Prone</h4>
        <p>You are on the ground, which may be from an effect or taking too much damage on one turn. When the state is inflicted you may make a Vitality roll, otherwise you gain an error die in your cache. You may get back up from the ground at any time as a Minor Action.</p>

        <h4>Shocked</h4>
        <p>When being inflicted by Shock, you must remove one die from the most valuable pair currently in the register. The value of this does account for dice in the cache, but not additional stats or modifiers that would affect otherwise. The number of dice lost this way increases with each subsequent Shock.</p>

        <h4>Stunned</h4>
        <p>You lose your next turn.</p>

        <h4>Vulnerable</h4>
        <p>When an action fails completely, and you have no possible sets to create a basic action, or your basic action was completely removed from repeated Hit Stun, you are Vulnerable until your next turn. While Vulnerable, you take +1 more damage to all attacks.</p>
