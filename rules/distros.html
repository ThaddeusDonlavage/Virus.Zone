            <h2>The Nature of Power</h2>
            <p>The invocation of magic, across numerous cultures, have all required a catalyst. Whether, through prayer, an incantation, a ritual or sacrifice, there was an understanding that bending the world has a real cost, and potential kickback. Although once isolated, inconsistant and dangerous, these ancient features are now accessible through the COMP system. However, the methods of invocation, have bifurcated into a few main traditions, which have been described as The Distributions.</p>
            <p>Forging a path through the Veil, is only possible with a COMP, and a willing contract with that COMPs defined Distribution.</p>
