        <p>A COMP (Cognitive Operating Matrix Platform) is a cybernetic device that interfaces with the user's senses, enhancing mental capabilities and providing access to digital networks. COMPs serve as both tools and companions, offering a range of functionalities from data processing and hacking to augmented reality overlays and virtual assistance. They are integral to navigating the complex interplay between the physical world and the digital realm, often acting as a bridge to the cosmOS and the Veil. Different COMP models cater to various user needs, from utility-focused designs to those capable of evoking psychic phenomena, making them essential for survival and success in a world where reality is increasingly intertwined with technology.
        </p>

        <p> Due to their obfuscated and proprietary nature, it is difficult to create a COMP out of any device, typically requiring specialized manufacturing and software. However, skilled technomancers may attempt to rig basic COMP functionalities using salvaged tech and custom code, though such creations are often unstable and limited in capability.
        </p>

        <p> Another important note is that COMPs also require a contract between the user and the device, often symbolized through a ritualistic process or agreement. This contract binds the COMP to the user, but it may also come with risks, such as increased susceptibility to corruption or influence from external entities.
        </p>

        <h2>COMP Features</h2>
        <p><strong>Chip Capacity: </strong> The maximum amount of data a COMP can process at once, affecting its performance and multitasking abilities. Chip Capacity provides the maximum number of Chips that can be equipped from storage.</p> 
        <p><strong>Cache Size: </strong> Sets the maximum number of die that can be stored within the cache.</p>
        <p><strong>Thread Count: </strong> Provides the number of Called Actions that can be performed per turn. COMPs with more than 1 Thread are considered fairly powerful.</p>
        <p><strong>Battery Life: </strong> Indicates how long the COMP can operate before needing a recharge or battery replacement.</p>
